## 🐋 Docker & Build Files

### 1. `docker-compose.yml`

  - **Security Fix:** Addresses CVE-2025-49844 (critical remote code execution vulnerability)
  - Added security comment about keeping Redis internal-only
  
- ✅ Added documentation for external network
  - Clarified that `remotely-net` is optional
  - Provided instructions for creating or removing the network

**Services with platform specification:**
- api-gateway

- ifcpatch-worker
- ifcconvert-worker
- ifcclash-worker
- ifccsv-worker
- ifctester-worker

## 🧩 Source Code

### 5. `api-gateway/api-gateway.py`

**Health Check Improvements:**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Changed initial queue status from `"unhealthy"` to `"waiting"`
- ✅ Changed message for uninitialized queues from `"unhealthy (queue key not found in Redis)"` to `"waiting (no jobs yet)"`
- ✅ Changed log level from `WARNING` to `INFO` for uninitialized queues
- ✅ Added helpful log message: "this is normal on first startup"
- ✅ Updated overall status logic to consider `"waiting (no jobs yet)"` as healthy
- ✅ Changed error checking condition from `"unhealthy"` to `"waiting"`

**Impact:**
- First-time users won't see alarming "unhealthy" messages
- Queue initialization is now clearly communicated as normal behavior
- Overall system health shows "healthy" even when queues haven't been used yet

## 📝 Notes for Maintainers

- **Python 3.11** is now the standard - keep all Dockerfiles in sync
- **ifcopenshell 0.8.0** is pinned - update carefully and test on multiple platforms
- **Redis version** should be kept up-to-date for security patches
- **Platform specification** (`linux/amd64`) should remain for Python services
- **Health check logic** now treats "waiting" as healthy - maintain this behavior
- **Documentation** should stay comprehensive - new users benefit greatly
